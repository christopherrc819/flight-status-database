# Flight Status Database using Express / Node JS for backend and React library for frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This personal project was to create an inspirational flight board using Node / Express js on the back-end to pull static flight data using a REST API call from a hosted JSON database service. The create-react-app package was used to render the frontend with custom styled components and CSS animations.
